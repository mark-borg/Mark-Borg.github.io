A common assumption underlying many computer vision algorithms is that image noise is normally distributed. 
Is this a valid assumption?

Recently I was doing some investigations into error quantification and uncertainty estimation of computer vision algorithms.
Many algorithms must rely on particular assumptions in order to be able to generalise well. 
@Domingos2012 does a good job at discussing this point and highlights that assumptions are an essential element of *inductive learning* and is what leads to the well-known *bias* effect.
A common assumption taken by many computer vision algorithms is that image noise is uniformly distributed, i.e., it follows a Gaussian probability distribution.

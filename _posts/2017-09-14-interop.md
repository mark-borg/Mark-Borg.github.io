This is a blog entry on C++/C# interoperability.

{{ more }}

Recently I was working on a project where I needed to use C++ code from within a C# application.
Apart from calling and executing C++ functions from within C#, data needed to be passed back and forth across this divide.
This is not a trivial task, considering the different paradigms used by the two languages, mainly the 
[*unmanaged*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb677124.aspx) nature of C++ versus 
the [*managed*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb318664(v=vs.85).aspx) nature of C#.

As the project dealt with image processing functionality, some of the data that needed to be passed from C# to C++ and back consisted of
raw image buffers. 

In this blog I will briefly describe the mechanism used for performing C++/C# interoperability. 
Some code is also provided for handling the 'transfer' of data between the two languages.


### Managed code

C# is one of the programing languages forming part of Microsoft's 
[*.NET framework*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/introduction-to-the-csharp-language-and-the-net-framework).
C# programs get compiled into an intermediate type of language, called *IL*, 
that run on a virtual execution system, called [*Common Language Runtime (CLR)*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr).

Using Java as an analogy, think of the CLR as being the *Java VM (JVM)*. 
One difference is that, apart from C#, there are other languages in the .NET framework.
For example, F# and Visual Basic.
Programs written in these languages all get compiled to the same intermediate code that
executes on CLR. 

One characteristic of the .NET languages is that they make use of *managed* code.
In managed code, the CLR takes responsibility of managing the memory and other resources of the 
programs. This `management' can include garbage collection, control of the lifetime of objects, 
enhanced debugging functionality, etc.

In constrast, in umanaged code like that of C++, the runtime system knows little about the memory
and resources used by the program and can provide minimal services. 
It's the program's responsibility to manage such objects and resources.

One of the issues faced in making C++ code interoperable with C# is how to 
go about moving data across the boundary between managed and unmanaged code. 
This process is known as **marshaling**.


### Interoperability mechanisms

The .NET framework provides different ways of achieving interoperability. These are:
- Platform Invocation (P/Invoke)
- C++ Interop
- COM Interop
- Embedded Interop types

**Platform Invocation** (**PInvoke** for short) allows for managed code to call native 
unmanaged functions implemented as DLLs. This method is ideal for when we have 
API-like functions written in C or C++ that need to be accessed from within a C# program. 
For further info on PInvoke follow this [link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2x8kf7zx.aspx).

**C++ Interop** is also known as *implict PInvoke* and informally referred to as
*It Just Works*. This mechanism consists of wrapping a native C++ class so that
it can be consumed by C# code. More details on this method can be found 
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/using-cpp-interop-implicit-pinvoke).

**COM Interop** is a mechanism specifically for exposing COM components to a .NET 
language. In other words, the unmanaged code must be encapsulated as a COM object for this mechanism to be applicable.

A recent mechanism that was introduced with .NET version 4.0 is 
[**Embedded Interop Types**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/type-equivalence-and-embedded-interop-types).
This is based on defining the equivalence of types.

For my image processing-based project, I opted for the PInvoke method mainly
because it fits quite well with the API-style of usage of the C++ code.


### PInvoke

The diagram below summarises the PInvoke mechanism.


![PInvoke diagram](/img/posts/pinvoke-diagram.png)


The native C++ code is compiled as a DLL with C-type linkage used for the exported
functions ('DLL function 1' and 'DLL function 2' in the diagram above).

The C++ functions to be invoked must also be declared in the C++ code. 
These declarations are called the *managed signatures* of the functions, and
must specify the name of the DLL library in which they reside, obviously the function
names, the return types of the functions, and the input parameters of the functions.

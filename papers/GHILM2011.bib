  abstract	= { A key issue in the design of high quality concatenative speech synthesis systems is that of providing a phonetically rich corpus of recorded speech. In this study, we present a novel approach for the automatic generation of a free-running text corpus for Maltese, using which, a speech database of recorded utterances can be constructed. A significantly large corpus of approximately 33 million words was gathered from websites, newspapers, books and ocial documents. This digital corpus was cleaned, transformed using a grapheme-to-phoneme strategy, and subsequently analysed to quantify concatenative unit coverage. A greedy selection strategy was then applied to the digital text and a smaller, more manageable corpus, which preserves the features and coverage of the larger text, was compiled. The selection strategy is addressed in detail in this paper. The quality of the resulting text compared favourably to texts generated using other selection methods, including manual selection. }

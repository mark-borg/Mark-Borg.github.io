After more than 10 years, I have decided to let go of the website www.lightningcube.com. 

{{ more }}

Below are some screenshots of the website for posterity.

The applications that were hosted on www.lightningcube.com can now be found on xxxxxxxxxxxx.

I have also decided to make the source code freely available. It's now quite old, using old technology, Windows MFC for the GUI. Please note that apart from minor modifications, the main codebase remained virtually unchanged for around 10 years. But some parts might still prove to be useful. This is especially true for the image processing algorithms used by these applications.

The source code is hosted on GitHub on xxxxxxxxxx.

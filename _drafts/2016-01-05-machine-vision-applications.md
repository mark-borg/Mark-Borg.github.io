While organising a backup drive, I came across two *Machine Vision*-related applications that were written sometime in the period 2005 -- 2006. 
I am uploading the source code on Github for posterity.

The source code for the two applications, named *BarcodeReader* and *CheckProductLabel*, can be found [here](https://github.com/mark-borg/BarcodeReader) and [here](https://github.com/mark-borg/CheckProductLabel). These two applications were developed as Demo programs to be sent to some prospective clients that I was in contact with at the moment. These clients were interested in enhancing automation and quality assurance of their production lines.
